# Python Package Exercise

Our project is Harry Potter-based and is split into five different functions: 
- A wizard name generator
  - This function takes a theme like "American" or "bizarre" and utilizes OpenAi to create a name.

- Choose Hogwarts House
  - It takes your house preference like the sorting hat would
- Choose a Harry Potter-themed Candy
  - Takes the number of candies and chooses them randomly from a pre-defined list 
- Generate a Harry Potter fighting spell. 
  - It takes the number of spells to be generated, utilizes Latin prefixes and suffixes, and randomly   mixes them to create a fighting spell. The Spells are returned in a 2D array where the inner array    has four elements: the Latin prefix and suffix and the English translation.
