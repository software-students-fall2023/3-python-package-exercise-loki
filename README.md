## Project Overview

Our project is Harry Potter-based and is split into five different functions:

1. **Wizard Name Generator**
   - This function takes a theme like "American" or "bizarre" and utilizes OpenAI to create a wizard name.

2. **Choose a Harry Potter Themed Animal**
   - It takes in a house, and based on that house, it prompts the user with a set of questions and returns an animal.

3. **Choose Hogwarts House**
   - It takes your house preference like the sorting hat would.

4. **Choose a Harry Potter-themed Candy**
   - Takes the number of candies and chooses them randomly from a pre-defined list.

5. **Generate a Harry Potter Fighting Spell**
   - It takes the number of spells to be generated, utilizes Latin prefixes and suffixes, and randomly mixes them to create a fighting spell. The spells are returned in a 2D array where the inner array has four elements: the Latin prefix and suffix, and the English translation.
